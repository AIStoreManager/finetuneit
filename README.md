# finetuneit

This finetuning project allows users to easily create finetuning files and upload them to OpenAI to refine the output of an OpenAI model.

Download the repo to your device and run npm install. (npm start to start the server)

This will set up the dependencies for both frontend and backend services.

Once the process is complete, a new tab will open on localhost:3000 with an empty file to which you can append conversations and message lines.

Due to privacy concerns, the finetuning file has been added to gitignore.

For the moment, I haven't completed the "upload to open ai" part, and you will have to do it yourself from your terminal, once the finetuning file is populated. 
Take a look at the official OpeanAI guide for more info on that: https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-5-turbo-fine-tuning-and-api-updates
